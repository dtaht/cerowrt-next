Add the generic AM33XX AES module's device tree data and
enable it for the am335x-evm, am335x-evmsk, and am335x-bone
platforms.  Also add Documentation file describing the data
for the AES module.

+OMAP SoC AES crypto Module
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible : Should contain entries for this and backward compatible
+  AES versions:
+  - "ti,omap2-aes" for OMAP2.
+  - "ti,omap3-aes" for OMAP3.
+  - "ti,omap4-aes" for OMAP4 and AM33XX.
+  Note that the OMAP2 and 3 versions are compatible (OMAP3 supports
+  more algorithms) but they are incompatible with OMAP4.
+- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated with the AES module
+- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the module
+- interrupts : the interrupt-specifier for the AES module.
+
+Optional properties:
+- dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
+	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
+- dma-names: DMA request names should include "tx" and "rx" if present.
+
+Example:
+	/* AM335x */
+	aes: aes@53500000 {
+		compatible = "ti,omap4-aes";
+		ti,hwmods = "aes";
+		reg = <0x53500000 0xa0>;
+		interrupts = <102>;
+		dmas = <&edma 6>,
+		       <&edma 5>;
+		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
+	};
